"AL-2012-04-24-03.tif","Clarke County","AL","August 2006","A reconstruction of the paleoenvironment of the Gulf region during the time of deposition of the rocks near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (around 38 million years ago). Much of southern Alabama and Mississippi was submerged in a shallow sea during the Oligocene Period. The marine sediments deposited during this period include the limestone, chalk, marl, and shale exposed in the uplands of Clarke County today (Soil Survey of Clarke County, Alabama; August 2006).",""
"AL-2012-04-24-04.tif","Clarke County","AL","August 2006","Origin of a salt bed: Millions of years ago, a part of the Costal Plain area was reminiscent of the area around the Great Salt Lake. During this much drier climate, an evaporative salt deposit formed in the bed of a shallow sea. Subsequently it was covered over by tens of thousands of feet of sedimentary layers as sea level rose and fell over long periods of time (Soil Survey of Clarke County, Alabama; August 2006).",""
"AL-2012-04-24-05.tif","Clarke County","AL","August 2006","Salt dome formation: Over geologic time, the weight of several thousands of feet of water-laden sediments exerted pressure on the once-flat salt bed, causing an upward welling of the salt. As the less dense, plastic salt thrust upward, it deformed the overlying sedimentary layers. Faulting and folding resulted, and cracks and fissures formed along this zone of deformation allowing oil and natural gas deposits to rise upward. The gas and oil collected in traps formed by dense layers of clays and bedrock surrounding porous layers of sands and soft shales. The formation of salt domes caused deformation of the local landscape, resulting in increased relief, exposure of older sediments to weathering, and creation of salty artesian springs (Soil Survey of Clarke County, Alabama; August 2006).",""
"AL-2012-04-24-06.tif","Clarke County","AL","August 2006","The Hatchetigbee Anticline, which is more than 30 miles long and 15 miles wide, resulted from a convex upward folding of the bedded sediments. The uplifting mechanism is thought to be a salt dome. Erosion of the deformed strata during the uplifting has resulted in rugged topography and exposure of sedimentary beds that normally would be overlain by younger sediments (Soil Survey of Clarke County, Alabama; August 2006).",""

The footslope is the gentle, slightly-concave slope at the base of the backslope. A toeslope portion of the footslope may be differentiated by a thicker accumulation of pedisediment than on the upper footslope. The different forms suggest both the variability seen in nature and the genetic sequence resulting from shoulder rounding and backslope retreat: (A) a hillform—or, by extrapolation, a mountainform—with a broad, flattish summit and sharply angular shoulders, such as would occur if the summit were directly underlain by a resistant stratum or soil horizon.

(C) A hillform with broadly rounded shoulders that have met and formed a crest lower than the original summit. The backslope has no straight-slope portion.

The downward inset of each successive segment of the diagram allows the profiles to be shown and suggests progressive lowering of the divide once the shoulders have joined.
