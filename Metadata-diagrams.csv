During this much drier climate, an evaporative salt deposit formed in the bed of a shallow sea.

As the less dense, plastic salt thrust upward, it deformed the overlying sedimentary layers. Faulting and folding resulted, and cracks and fissures formed along this zone of deformation allowing oil and natural gas deposits to rise upward. The gas and oil collected in traps formed by dense layers of clays and bedrock surrounding porous layers of sands and soft shales. The formation of salt domes caused deformation of the local landscape, resulting in increased relief, exposure of older sediments to weathering, and creation of salty artesian springs (Soil Survey of Clarke County, Alabama; August 2006).",

Multiple glacial episodes and ice levels shaped this valley, leaving traces of features such as glacial-valley walls and floors, scoured lava flows, moraines and outwash plains. The more recent glaciations were generally less extensive and cut into and deposited over preexisting glacial features. Moraines and outwash plains formed as the gradient flattened beyond the confining bedrock of Lassen Peak and Loomis Peak. The active colluvial nature of Lassen Peak has shed many of the glacial features that were formed on it. Chaos Crags erupted and was emplaced after glaciations, obliterating any glacial features that existed there prior to the eruption. Thick deposits of tephra were deposited around the vent of dome A of Chaos Crags and covered a large area of the northern part of the park with thinner deposits. A rockfall avalanche formed at the base of the unstable volcanic dome of Chaos Crags. Debris flows from eruptions of Lassen Peak flowed off of the peak and were deposited in flat valley bottoms (Soil Survey of Lassen Volcanic National Park, California; 2010).","Acroph, Aquepts, Chaos, Cragwash, Emeraldlake, Readingpeak, Sueredo, Shadowlake, Terracelake, Typic Petraquepts, Vitrandic Cryorthents, Vitrandic Xerorthents, Xeric Vitricryands"

Narrow tops of joined shoulders are called crests. Their surface is the same age as the sideslopes. The backslope may have a straight upper part or be concave throughout its length. The footslope is the gentle, slightly-concave slope at the base of the backslope. A toeslope portion of the footslope may be differentiated by a thicker accumulation of pedisediment than on the upper footslope. The different forms suggest both the variability seen in nature and the genetic sequence resulting from shoulder rounding and backslope retreat: (A) a hillform—or, by extrapolation, a mountainform—with a broad, flattish summit and sharply angular shoulders, such as would occur if the summit were directly underlain by a resistant stratum or soil horizon. (B) A hillform with a broad summit, rounded shoulders, and a short, straight, upper backslope. (C) A hillform with broadly rounded shoulders that have met and formed a crest lower than the original summit. The backslope has no straight-slope portion. (D) A hillform where retreated backslopes have lowered and sharpened the crest. The downward inset of each successive segment of the diagram allows the profiles to be shown and suggests progressive lowering of the divide once the shoulders have joined. However, the footslope would not be down-worn as the backslope retreated (cf., Fig. 16) and the crest position could be offset by unequal backslope retreat.",

A schematic, cross section diagram of pediment formation by the retreat, or backwearing, of an erosional slope (positions 1 through 12) into a relatively old summit surface (s). Material eroded from the shoulder and backslope washes across the footslope, or pediment (P), to a channel (c) as a layer of pedisediment (ps) that commonly is thicker toward the toeslope. The pedisediment lies on top of the actual erosion surface (a) which may be marked by a stoneline, as indicated by the line of dots (Landforms of the Basin & Range Province Defined for Soil Survey; 1981).",

Hypothetical erosional hiIIforms and dissection landforms illustrating how slope component names can be used to describe the physiographic positions of soils. The slope components are: summit (m), crest (c), shoulder (s), backslope (b), footslope (f), and toeslope (t). A drainageway (x) that has been so deeply alluviated that the former footslope and toeslope are buried now contains an inset fan. The hill at the upper left has its backslope interrupted by a cliff formed by a resistant stratum. The other particularly broadly and smoothly rounded hill is called a ballon (A.G.I., 1972). The ridges at the lower left are ballenas if cut in fan alluvium. The summit above the erosional slopes cut by the gully system at the lower right would be relict fan surfaces if underlain by fan alluvium, or in this depicted situation, they could be remnants of a pediment left by retreat of the hillslopes. Note the curving, or cuspate, planimetric pattern of the footslopes (i.e., pediments) of the drainageway bottoms (Landforms of the Basin & Range Province Defined for Soil Survey; 1981).",
