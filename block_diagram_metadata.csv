Multiple glacial episodes and ice levels shaped this valley, leaving traces of features such as glacial-valley walls and floors, scoured lava flows, moraines and outwash plains. The more recent glaciations were generally less extensive and cut into and deposited over preexisting glacial features. Moraines and outwash plains formed as the gradient flattened beyond the confining bedrock of Lassen Peak and Loomis Peak. The active colluvial nature of Lassen Peak has shed many of the glacial features that were formed on it. Chaos Crags erupted and was emplaced after glaciations, obliterating any glacial features that existed there prior to the eruption. Thick deposits of tephra were deposited around the vent of dome A of Chaos Crags and covered a large area of the northern part of the park with thinner deposits. A rockfall avalanche formed at the base of the unstable volcanic dome of Chaos Crags. Debris flows from eruptions of Lassen Peak flowed off of the peak and were deposited in flat valley bottoms (Soil Survey of Lassen Volcanic National Park, California; 2010)."

Ice level fluctuations caused glaciers to override the drainage divide between the valleys as well as exist as confined valley glaciers within the individual valleys. Outwash was deposited in the flat bottom of the U-shaped valley along Hot Springs Creek.

The glaciers did not completely cover Red Cinder, Ash Butte and Mount Hoffman. Red Cinder Cone and Ash Butte retained much of their cinder cone shape and composition, and Mount Hoffman formed a nunatak composed of remnants of the Dittmar Volcanic Center. Outwash was deposited in the lower flatter reach of the valley. The lake terraces are likely remnants of the fluctuations of a glacial lake.

The creek has cut through the volcanic Tuscan Formation and is now cutting through hard Lovejoy basalt. The resistant Lovejoy basalt confines the stream channel, and a narrow slot canyon has formed at the bottom of the wider Tuscan Canyon. As the creek leaves the confinement of the slot canyon and enters the flatter topography of the valley, the energy of the water decreases, causing sediment to be deposited. As sediment fills the channel, the channel begins to move laterally. The channel slowly migrates away from the sediment deposits, allowing the sediment to form into alluvial soils (Soil Survey of Butte Area, California, Parts of Butte and Plumas Counties; 2006)."
